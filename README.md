[JSF03] Project: Vue Challenge

# Project Overview
- For the project 'JSF03', I was tasked with using the starter code from the CodeSpace-Academy repo in order to refactor into an Vue.js based project. The repo included an e-commerce store which uses an API to fetch all the data that is displayed in the store, the store was a React based project that included all the accompanying components to build out the e-commerce store. I had to use my new-found knowledge to accomplish this brief and find a way to complete the brief.

# Project Brief 
1. Study and understand the Vue e-commerce store rubric provided in your student sheet.

2. Have a look at the model e-commerce store provided in React: https://github.com/CodeSpace-Academy/jsf-react-ecommerce.

3. Study the Fake Store API and see what endpoints you will need to fetch different pieces of data from.

4. Code your solution in Vue and document your code with JSDoc.

5. Commit changes to your Github repository (remember the naming convention: Module_4_StudentNo_Classcode_Group_Name-Surname_JSF02)

6. Add a README.md file with the project description, how to set it up, technologies used and other information specified in the rubric

7. Test your application for any bugs and improvements.

8. Verify that your changes have been successfully pushed to your remote GitHub repository

9. Submit the GitHub Repository Link to the LMS JSF02 Submission Project Tab.


# Technologies Used 
Vue.js: An open-source JavaScript framework designed to build user interfaces (UIs) for the web
TailwindCSS: A utility-first CSS framework for styling and layout.
Vite: A modern development server and build tool for efficient development and deployment.
Fake Store API: A RESTful API for fetching e-commerce data.


# How to run the project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the project in development mode.
4. Open your web browser and navigate to the localhost link to access the e-commerce store.

# Usage examples

- Sort the products by price: highest to lowest and vice versa
- Filter products by category
- Select products to view their description and reviews

# Reflections
### Areas of Mastery 
- First time using the Vue.js framework, so I did not gain any areas of mastery but i did gain proficiency in using the Vue syntax. 

### Challenges faced
- Learning the Vue.js framework and its ecosystem.
- Handling state management and props in Vue.js.

### Areas of Improvement
- Improving my understanding of Vue.js and its best practices.
- Enhancing the user experience with more features and functionality (this will be implemented in future projects using Vue.js).

# Overall Learning Experience
- Learning about the Vue.js framework was quite an informative process. I learnt quite a lot and it always left me wanting for more knowledge throughout the project. Trying to figure out what works for what specific reason and what clashes with the Vue code logic or syntax was a very fulfilling experience. Finding out how to break the code and fix it, just for the sake of learning what makes Vue.js tick, was an easy thing to explore regarding the whole brief was a simple refactor and the final UI and functionality had already been predetermined.
